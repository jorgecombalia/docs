Zlib
====

Zlib is a software library written in C language used for data compression. For more information about this library, visit its official website or Documentation.

This is the biicode library site and this is the biicode library examples.

Usage example (difficulty: medium)
----------------------------------

To check this library, we're making an example to compress and decompress a single file. Then you could create a \*.h and a \*.cpp file named infdef (inflate and deflate) and a zpipe.cpp which would be, for example, in ``~/project_directory/blocks/user_name/project_name/``.

The following code would be in each one.

**infdef.h**

.. literalinclude:: /_static/code/cpp/examples/zlib/infdef.h
   :language: cpp
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 3,4,5,16



**infdef.cpp**

.. literalinclude:: /_static/code/cpp/examples/zlib/infdef.cpp
   :language: cpp
   :linenos:



**zpipe.cpp**

.. literalinclude:: /_static/code/cpp/examples/zlib/zpipe.cpp
   :language: cpp
   :linenos:

   
**Download:** :download:`zpipe.zip </_static/code/cpp/examples/zlib/zpipe.zip>`
    


Then, you need find all the depencies of your project, in this case, zlib.h, so execute in console

.. code-block:: bash

	$ bii find

Next, you can already run the code:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ cd bin
	$ #run executable

Then you'll be requested to select compression or decompression any file, and the file source name and file destination name.

This will be the output if you would want to compress a file.txt which is in your desktop directory and the compressed name file would be file.gz. The last one will be created in your ~/project_directory/bin/ directory

.. code-block:: bash

	Do you want to compress or decompress a file (to exit 'CTRL+C')? <comp|decomp>
	comp
	Enter file source name:
	C:\Users\Usuario\Desktop\file.txt
	Enter file destination name:
	file.gz
	The original file size is: 16944
	The file size after being compressed is: 5152


In this case file.txt had a size of 16944 bytes and file.gz 5152 bytes.

Now, if you want to decompress the file.gz to check all is correct, run the code again and the output will be the next

.. code-block:: bash

	Do you want to compress or decompress a file (to exit 'CTRL+C')? <comp|decomp>
	decomp
	Enter file source name:
	file.gz
	Enter file destination name:
	myfile.txt
	The original file size is: 5152
	The file size after being decompressed is: 16944

Finally, you can see that the new file, myfile.txt, has been created in the ~/project_directory/bin/ directory and itÂ´s exactly like the file.txt in terms of size and content.
